This app invites you to the magic of xmas!

This project was requested from a friend for Christmas celebration. It allows users to register their names on December 24th, and throughout the year leading up to the next Christmas, displays the names of those who have registered. The code is built to manage user registration, display countdowns, and provide feedback messages.
